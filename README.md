# Job Market Analysis using Python + MySQL

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes job postings data stored in a MySQL database.  
Using **Python, Pandas, SQLAlchemy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn**, I connected to the database, ran SQL queries, and visualized insights.  

The goal was to uncover trends such as salary distribution, most in-demand job titles, state-wise job availability, and job posting trends.
